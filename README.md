# Moving Forward

## Project Description
'Moving Forward' is the promotional website for my film 'Moving Forward.' The film is an incredibly special piece to me because of its universality. Through an affirmative montage featuring humans and animals moving forward while Bee Gees plays in the background, it pleasantly says:
### "Whoever you are, keep moving forward"
To create an immersive, living experience that breathed 'Moving Forward,' I wanted the audience to move forward to unlock the film instead of effortlessly handing it to them on the first webpage. Simultaneously, I did not intend to overwhelm the audience with information on the first webpage. Therefore, I began with an initial 'start' button containing a brief introduction and dynamic, autotyped remarks by people that led the audience through a linear journey through the various aspects of the film: philosophy, awards won, and behind-the-scenes pictures. 

As the ultimate cherry on the cake, I created javascript sketches containing controllable avatars that enabled the users to move forward to the following webpage until the last one. Naturally, I gave them the option to move backward after the last page if they intended to. Overall, I wanted the experience to 'show' the idea of moving forward instead of telling it through mere words.

## Process
#### Vibe
To implement the concept, I decided a premium, black background with golden and red elements for a welcoming contrast.
#### Elements
The limited, mostly traditional, fonts that HTML supports hindered my vision of artsy product emanating a sheen of consummate professionalism. Therefore, after deciding the locations of my elements - philosophy, awards, start button, titles, descriptions - I created them on photoshop and added them as images.
#### P5JS Sketches
Using Javascript's creative coding library p5js, I created sketches of avatars moving forward via for loops and 2D sprites. Then, I enabled the audience to control them via keyboard keys. A single line of code helped me embed the sketches directly onto the website.
#### Film 
I uploaded my film on Google Drive. Then, I used one line of code containing the link to embed it onto my final webpage. 
#### Images Slideshow
To create a more intimate experience, I gave the audience access to some behind the scenes images through an automated slideshow I learnt via YouTube.
#### Autotyped Remarks
The first webpage seemed too static compared to the others. Therefore, I added autotyped fictional remarks by people using a YouTube tutorial. Short and easy to follow, I added a mix of formal and fun-sounding informal remarks. It added a degree of legitimacy to the project.

## Reflection
While crafting the initial wireframe, I planned on keeping everything on one page. However, I realized it was an informational overload while also failing to support the theme of _moving forward_. Once I figured the overarching experience I endeavored to deliver to the audience, the nitty gitty mostly took care of itself. What I wanted to create, I created perfectly. However, I did confront challenges in this taxing yet rewarding journey.

Naturally, using newly learnt languages - HTML and CSS - and sculpting a compelling, immersive website was challenging. Formatting and placing content with precision was a hassle. Visual appeal is undeniably crucial and using CSS to create classes for specific objects was of huge help. One thing that aided debugging was the inspect function of Google Chrome. An exciting discovery was realizing I could embed projects from Javascript's creative coding library called 'p5js' using only a line of code.

Conclusively, there's obviously a long way to go. However, by practicing, failing, debugging, and expanding my creative horizons through analyzing great websites and resources, I can achieve a level beyond my perception. Hopefully, the culmination of this improvement will manifest itself in the final portfolio submission.
