# Moving Forward

## Project Description
What is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create?
'Moving Forward' is the promotional website for my film 'Moving Forward.' The film is an incredibly special piece to me because of its universality. Through an affirmative montage featuring humans and animals moving forward while Bee Gees plays in the background, it pleasantly says:
### "Whoever you are, keep moving forward"

## Process
How did you go about implementing the concept?

## Reflection
This should bookend the initial concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version.
