# Moving Forward

## Project Description
'Moving Forward' is the promotional website for my film 'Moving Forward.' The film is an incredibly special piece to me because of its universality. Through an affirmative montage featuring humans and animals moving forward while Bee Gees plays in the background, it pleasantly says:
### "Whoever you are, keep moving forward"
To create an immersive, living experience that breathed 'Moving Forward,' I wanted the audience to _move forward_ to unlock the film instead of effortlessly handing it to them on the first webpage. Simultaneously, I did not intend to overwhelm the audience with information on the first webpage. Therefore, I began with an intial 'start' button containing a brief introduction and dynamic, autotyped remarks by people that led the audience through a linear journey through the various aspects of the film: philosophy, awards won, and behind the scenes pictures. As an ultimate cherry on the cake, I created javascript sketches containing controllable avatars that enabled the users to _move forward_ to the next webpage until reaching the last one. Naturally, I gave them the option to move backwards after the last page if they intended to. Overall, I wanted the experience to 'show' the idea of moving forward instead of tell it through mere words.

## Process
How did you go about implementing the concept?

## Reflection
This should bookend the initial concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version.
